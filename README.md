# MIPS Pipelined CPU
This project implements a MIPS pipelined processor with five stages: Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back. 

For the full processor, enter cp4-processor. A more in-depth description can be shown there.

**NOTE:** I don't want to misrepresent my work here. I did not make the compiler or assembler in cp4/ece350-assembler-windows, nor did I write the Wrapper, ROM, or RAM. However, happy to explain how they generally work!
